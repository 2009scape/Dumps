<br>
<span class="title">4. Using the Account Recovery module</span><br><br>
Every FunOrb account is accessed via a unique username and player-chosen password. We encourage our players to choose a password that is easy for them to remember but difficult for others to guess. To avoid forgetting their password, we advise our players to write it down on a piece of paper and keep it safe. We also stress that players should never divulge their password to anybody else, including friends and family.
<br><br>
If a player discloses their password for any reason, they leave it open for others to use. If you are having problems accessing your account, it could be that somebody else knows your password and has subsequently changed it. If this occurs, or you simply cannot remember your password, you can try to retrieve your lost account by submitting a password recovery form. This form can be found by clicking <a href="http://www.funorb.com/g=voidhunters/redirect.ws?mod=www&dest=loginapplet/loginapplet.ws?mod=accountappeal&dest=beginappeal.ws&ssl=0">here</a>.
<br><br>
<img style="display: block; margin: 0 auto 0 auto;" src="http://www.funorb.com/img/images/kbase/password_recovery/login_options1.gif" alt="Password Recovery log-in" title="Password Recovery log-in">
<br><br>
It is extremely important that you choose the correct type of query, as this makes it more likely that we will be able to resolve your problem.
<br><br>
If you have registered an email address for your account, you will be asked to provide it. If we can confirm that the provided email address has been registered and verified, we will then send a security code to the provided email address. You should copy the code from the email and enter it into the appropriate box on the account recovery form. If you have not registered an email address for your account, or if you have forgotten which address you registered, simply leave the email box blank and carry on with the account recovery process.
<br><br>
The account recovery form will then appear. This needs to be completed. It may be the case that not all the questions are relevant to your account, but those that are should be filled in clearly and correctly. The more relevant the information we receive, the better the chance we have of determining the true owner of the account. The information you will need to provide includes:
<br><br>
<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">
<li>Your recovery answers<br>
<li>Previous passwords</ul>
<br><br>
There is also a field for providing extra information to prove your ownership of the account. Usually, you can find your transaction ID and other billing numbers in the notification you will have received confirming your payment. For this reason, it is very important that you do not throw them away or misplace them.
<br><br>
If you do not know or cannot remember all your account information, please try to provide the earliest information you have for each of the categories requested. This will ensure that your request is dealt with as quickly as possible. We can only issue a new password to an account once we are satisfied that it will be returned to the correct owner.
<br><br>
Try to fill in as much information as clearly as possible, to increase the likelihood that your request will be successful. You will also need to supply a new password; we recommend you read <a href="password_security">this article</a> to ensure that your new password is as secure as possible.
<br><br>
<b>Query Tracking</b>
<br><br>
In order to track a player’s password request, they are given a unique ‘Tracker ID’. To follow the progress of the query, please click <a href="http://www.funorb.com/g=voidhunters/redirect.ws?mod=accountappeal&dest=trackinginput.ws">here</a>.
<br><br>
This will bring up a page asking you to enter the Tracker ID:
<br><br>
<img style="display: block; margin: 0 auto 0 auto;" src="http://www.funorb.com/img/images/kbase/parents_guide/password_tracker2.gif" alt="Password Recovery Tracker" title="Password Recovery Tracker">
<br><br>
Type in your username and tracker ID and you will be told what stage your password recovery request is at. Please note that some password recovery requests may take longer to process than others.
